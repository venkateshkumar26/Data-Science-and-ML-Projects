# AI & Machine Learning Project Portfolio

Welcome to my **AI/ML Engineering Portfolio**, a collection of end-to-end projects built to demonstrate practical expertise across the ML lifecycle — from data preprocessing and model development to deployment, optimization, and MLOps practices.  
Each project in this repository is designed with **industry relevance**, **clean architecture**, and **deployment-ready pipelines**.

This repository is continuously updated with new work and research-oriented experiments.
